## Hreflang

### Placement Methods

Google supports three equivalent methods: HTML `<link>` in `<head>`, HTTP `Link` headers, and XML sitemap `<xhtml:link>` elements. Google confirmed no method is prioritized over another.

Google combines signals from both HTML and sitemaps. If the same language-region pair points to different URLs across methods, Google drops that pair rather than guessing.

- [SEJ: Google Combines Hreflang Signals](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-combines-hreflang-signals-from-html-sitemaps/389219/)

### Reciprocal Requirement

Google's docs: "If page X links to page Y, page Y must link back to page X. If not, those annotations may be ignored or not interpreted correctly."

Each locale URL should be represented consistently within its hreflang cluster, including the current page where required by the implementation model. Validate reciprocity and completeness against current authoritative search-engine documentation.

### x-default

Introduced April 2013. Designates the fallback page for users whose language/region matches no declared variant. Can point to the same URL as one of the language-specific alternates. Must be included in the complete set of annotations on every variant page.

- [Google Blog: How x-default can help you (2023)](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/x-default)

### Language & Region Codes

Language: ISO 639-1 (2-letter). Region: ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 (2-letter). Format: `language[-script][-region]`.

Use valid language and optional region identifiers according to the current search-engine specification. Validate codes against authoritative standards rather than relying on historical implementation-error statistics.

### Hreflang at Scale (20+ locales)

At scale, HTML hreflang increases per-page markup while sitemap-based hreflang moves that relationship data out of page delivery. Verify current sitemap size and entry limits from authoritative search-engine documentation before implementation.

John Mueller recommends focusing hreflang on pages receiving wrong-language traffic, not every page: "I wouldn't do it for any of the other pages of the site because it's so complex & hard to manage."

### Google vs Bing

Search engines may interpret internationalization signals differently. Verify current provider documentation for hreflang, HTML language attributes, regional signals and locale targeting before making provider-specific recommendations.

Use standards-based language metadata and hreflang where appropriate, but confirm current provider-specific support before prescribing a particular combination of signals.

## Canonicalization & i18n

### Self-Referencing Canonicals

Each locale page must canonical to itself. John Mueller: "Don't use a rel=canonical across languages/countries, only use it on a per-country/language basis."

Google's docs: "Specify a canonical page in the same language, or the best possible substitute language if a canonical doesn't exist for the same language."

- [John Mueller: hreflang canonical](https://johnmu.com/hreflang-canonical/)
- [Google: Consolidate Duplicate URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls)

### Canonical Overrides Hreflang

Mueller: "If your canonical is pointing somewhere else, Google will follow that and ignore your hreflang annotation." The canonical URL must be one of the URLs in the hreflang set, or all hreflang markup is ignored.

Google also states: "Google prefers URLs that are part of hreflang clusters for canonicalization" -- when signals align, hreflang strengthens canonical selection.

- [SEJ: Hreflang Tags Are Hints](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-reminds-that-hreflang-tags-are-hints-not-directives/546428/)
- [Google: Consolidate Duplicate URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls)

### Near-Duplicate Regional Variants

Mueller (2023 Office Hours): "If the content is completely the same, and we can't tell any difference, then for simplicity and user experience we may just show one version -- even if hreflang is present."

Google's duplicate detection runs BEFORE hreflang evaluation. To keep both versions indexed, you need substantive content differences beyond currency symbols.

- [Google: Managing Multi-Regional Sites](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites)

### Pagination Across Locales

Paginated locale pages should use intentional canonicalization that reflects the actual page content and navigation model. Historical pagination-link handling has changed over time, so verify current search-engine guidance before relying on provider-specific pagination signals.

## International Sitemaps

### Structure

Each `<url>` entry includes `<xhtml:link>` alternates for every locale. Requires `xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"` namespace.

Split sitemaps by content type, not by locale. Splitting by locale creates maintenance problems because every locale sitemap must reference every other locale (reciprocal requirement).

- [Google Search Central: Localized Versions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions)
- [Lumar: How Google Handles Hreflang](https://www.lumar.io/office-hours/hreflang/)

### Size Limits

Large international sitemaps must respect the search engine's current sitemap entry and file-size limits. Hreflang relationships can materially increase sitemap size, so validate current limits and split strategy before implementation.

- [Google: Build and Submit a Sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [SERoundtable: Sitemap 50,000 Limit](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-sitemap-50-000-limit-based-on-location-urls-not-alternative-urls-33843.html)

### Submission

Submit the sitemap index in Search Console AND reference it in robots.txt. Individual child sitemaps can be submitted separately for per-sitemap reporting.

- [Google: Build and Submit a Sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap)

### Next.js Caveat

Framework-generated sitemap and alternate-language behavior can change between releases. Verify the current Next.js metadata implementation before assuming that self-referencing hreflang entries are generated automatically.

- [Next.js Docs: sitemap.xml](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap)

## URL Structure

### Strategies Compared

Google treats subdirectories and subdomains equivalently. Mueller: "From our point of view...they say subdomains and subdirectories are essentially equivalent."

URL parameters (`?lang=en`) are explicitly "Not recommended" per Google docs.

- [Google: Managing Multi-Regional Sites](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites)

### Default Language

Mueller recommends: set `/` as x-default, put each language in its own prefix. Without marking `/` as x-default, "to Google it can look like '/' is a separate page from the others."

- [Google Blog: x-default](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/x-default)
- [Google Blog: Creating the Right Homepage](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/05/creating-right-homepage-for-your)

### Content Negotiation / IP Redirects

Locale-adaptive delivery can make discovery and indexing harder when crawlers receive different content based on location or request headers. Prefer stable, independently addressable locale URLs where appropriate, and verify current crawler behavior from authoritative documentation.

- [Google: Locale-Adaptive Pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/locale-adaptive-pages)

### Trailing Slash Consistency

Mueller: trailing slash is "a significant part of the URL and will change the URL if it's there or not." Pick one format for all locale paths, internal links, canonicals, hreflang, and sitemaps.

Maintain one consistent URL policy across internal links, canonicals, hreflang annotations and sitemaps.

- [SERoundtable: Consistency Is The Biggest Technical SEO Factor](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-consistency-seo-40427.html)

### Search Console Geotargeting

Search-console features and international-targeting controls can change over time. Verify the current reporting and configuration capabilities before recommending a provider-specific workflow.

- [Google Support: International Targeting Deprecated](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/12474899?hl=en)

### Framework Locale Modes

Framework locale-routing behavior is implementation-specific and version-sensitive. Prefer stable, distinct locale URLs where the SEO strategy requires independently discoverable language versions, and verify the current framework configuration before implementation.

## Content Quality Across Locales

### Automated Translation

Automated translation should be evaluated on usefulness, accuracy, intent and content quality rather than treated as acceptable or unacceptable solely because of the translation method. Verify current search-quality and spam-policy guidance when this materially affects a recommendation.

For production guidance, focus on whether each locale provides genuinely useful, accurate and complete content for its intended audience.

- [Glenn Gabe: Auto-Translating Content](https://www.gsqi.com/marketing-blog/auto-translating-content-google-scaled-content-abuse/)
- [SE Land: Reddit AI Translations](https://searchengineland.com/google-comments-on-reddits-use-of-ai-to-translate-its-pages-456908)

### Thin Locale Pages

Google: "Localized versions of a page are only considered duplicates if the main content of the page remains untranslated." Pages with only translated boilerplate get clustered as duplicates.

Do NOT use noindex for unwanted locale pages (wastes crawl budget). Do NOT canonical cross-locale (conflicts with hreflang). Best approach: don't create locale pages you can't make genuinely helpful.

- [Google: Crawl Budget Management](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/large-site-managing-crawl-budget)

### Helpful Content System Impact

Low-value content at scale can create broader quality risk. Treat historical ranking-system descriptions as time-sensitive and verify current official guidance before attributing a site-wide effect to a named ranking system.

Low-quality translated pages can drag down the entire site. This is the strongest argument against creating locale pages that aren't genuinely helpful.

- [Google Blog: Helpful Content Update](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update)
- [Amsive: What Changed in 2024](https://www.amsive.com/insights/seo/googles-helpful-content-update-ranking-system-what-happened-and-what-changed-in-2024/)

### Partial Translation

Google: "Translating only the boilerplate text of your pages while keeping the bulk of your content in a single language...can create a bad user experience." Google uses visible content (not lang attribute) to determine page language.

Translate ALL content on a page if you create a locale version. Untranslated metadata (title, description) in the wrong language reduces CTR.

- [Google: Managing Multi-Regional Sites](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites)

### Crawl Budget

Crawl-budget analysis is most relevant for sufficiently large or frequently changing sites. Evaluate actual crawl demand, crawl activity and URL scale instead of relying on fixed universal thresholds. Broken alternate URLs should still be treated as a technical defect.

- [Google Blog: Crawl Budget](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2017/01/what-crawl-budget-means-for-googlebot)

### Locale-Specific Signals

Google identifies audience via: "local addresses and phone numbers on the pages, the use of local language and currency, links from other local sites, or signals from your Business Profile."
